### **ImageSharp** is a new, fully featured, fully managed, cross-platform, 2D graphics API. 

ImageSharp is a new, fully featured, fully managed, cross-platform, 2D graphics library. 
Designed to simplify image processing, ImageSharp brings you an incredibly powerful yet beautifully simple API.

ImageSharp is designed from the ground up to be flexible and extensible. The library provides API endpoints for common image processing operations and the building blocks to allow for the development of additional operations.

Built against [.NET 8](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard), ImageSharp can be used in device, cloud, and embedded/IoT scenarios.

## Manual build

If you prefer, you can compile ImageSharp yourself (please do and help!)

- Using [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)
  - Make sure you have the latest version installed
  - Make sure you have [the .NET 8 SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#windows) installed

Alternatively, you can work from command line and/or with a lightweight editor on **both Linux/Unix and Windows**:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [C# Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.csharp)
- [.NET Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#linuxubuntu)

To clone ImageSharp locally, click the "Clone in [YOUR_OS]" button above or run the following git commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp
```

Then set the following config to ensure blame commands ignore mass reformatting commits.

```bash
git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
```

If working with Windows please ensure that you have enabled long file paths in git (run as Administrator).

```bash
git config --system core.longpaths true
```

This repository uses [Git Large File Storage](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage). Please follow the linked instructions to ensure you have it set up in your environment.

This repository contains [Git Submodules](https://blog.github.com/2016-02-01-working-with-submodules/). To add the submodules to the project, navigate to the repository root and type:

``` bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
